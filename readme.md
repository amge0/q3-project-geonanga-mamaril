# Q4 Project Update Plan
**Summary**: These updates will include a change in code in a few pages of the website to ensure that the website works properly. For the case of "Customize", its .js needs to include a function that'll save the room design to either "Drafts" or "Collections". The chosen favorites works in "Collections" will be shown in "Bookmarks" with a function as well.
Another type of update will be the addition of two new pages: (1) About the Creators and (2) Log in/Signup & Theme Generator. The first page will replace the Social Media page as its contents will transfer to the footer on every page while the second will ask for a username and password along with the user's preference, generating a room that fits their choice.

1. About the Creators Page

3. Image sizing

4. Save contents of "Customize" to either "Drafts" or "Collections"
