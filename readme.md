# Q4 Project Update Plan
**Summary**: These updates will include a change in code in a few pages of the website to ensure that the website works properly. For the case of _Customize_, its .js needs to include a function that'll save the room design to either _Drafts_ or _Collections_. The chosen favorites works in _Collections_ will be shown in _Bookmarks_ with a function as well.

Another type of update will be the addition of two new pages: (1) _About the Creators_ and (2) _Login/Signup & Theme Generator_. The first page will replace the Social Media page as its contents will transfer to the footer on every page while the second will ask for a username and password along with the user's preference, generating a room that fits their choice to give the website a game-like appearance.
